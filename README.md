### `Time for a quick introduction?`
I'm Joe, a Mechatronics and Robotics student from Leeds. Here's a lightning-round summary of who I am and what I do.

- ⚒️ Right now, I'm a summer intern for Rolls-Royce working on VVUQ for simulations
- 🎓 I'm in my 3rd year of uni, and I plan on undertaking a placement year before completing my Master's
- 💡 Recently, I've been looking into biomaterials and their relevance to soft robotics.
    - For my next project, I want to experiment with improving 3D printed hydrogels by reducing their shrinkage during the curing process
